# Brain-Tumour-Detection-

This project presents a deep learning approach to brain tumor segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Brain tumor segmentation is a challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of tumor appearances. CNNs have shown promising results in medical image analysis tasks, including brain tumor segmentation





The proposed system for brain tumor segmentation was compared with other recently developed systems that use different techniques such as CNN[1], Random Forest[2], ANN[3], D-CNN[4], SVM[5], and R-CNN[6]. The results showed that the Random Forest Classifier had the lowest accuracy at 86%, while the accuracy of CNN-based systems ranged between 91% and 96%, except for D-CNN, which achieved 98.07% accuracy. However, the proposed system outperformed all other systems, including D-CNN, with an accuracy that exceeded 98.07%. After a  clear comparison of all the systems the CNN model with deep layers and data augmented MRIs was the most effective.
